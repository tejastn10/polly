# Polly

**P.O.L.L.Y** - **Personal Organized Log for Learning and Yarning**

This repository is my personal space where I experiment, hack around, and document things I want to remember. It’s essentially a playground where I try out code snippets, concepts, and small projects, without the pressure of having to maintain or formalize anything. Feel free to explore, but note that this is a private collection of my learnings.

## Why Polly?

Polly is my **P**ersonal **O**rganized **L**og for **L**earning and **Y**arning—a place where I can quickly try out ideas, play with new tools, and keep track of my small hacks and experiments. It's not meant to be polished or collaborative, just a reference for myself to revisit later.

## What you'll find here

- Random scripts, notes, or configuration files.
- Experimentation with different programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Temporary projects or snippets that I may use in future, bigger projects.
- Code snippets, documentation hacks, and any other random tech stuff I find interesting.

## Contribution

This is a personal space—no contributions are expected or accepted. It’s just me playing around and trying things out.

## License

No formal license is applied since this repository is strictly for personal experimentation and usage.
